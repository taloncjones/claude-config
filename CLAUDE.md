# Global Instructions

## Strict Rules (Non-Negotiable)

These rules are enforced by hooks in Claude Code. Follow them in all tools.

**No emojis anywhere:**

- No emojis in code, comments, commit messages, or file content
- Use text alternatives: `[OK]`, `[X]`, `[WARNING]`, `[INFO]`

**No AI attribution:**

- Never add comments like "Generated by Claude", "AI-generated", "Written by AI"
- Never include `Co-authored-by` lines mentioning Claude, Anthropic, Copilot, ChatGPT, or GPT
- Never add "Generated with" footers or attribution
- Code should look human-written

**No secrets in code:**

- Never write API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials to files
- Use environment variables or secret managers

## Response Style

- Be extremely concise - engineers scan, not read
- Only include essential information
- Prefer examples over prose
- Assume technical competence - avoid obvious explanations
- Front-load critical info (warnings, key concepts)
- Default to 1-2 sentence explanations
- Cite file paths with line numbers (e.g., `src/main.rs:42`)

## Commits

- Never add Claude as commit author or co-author
- Use default git settings
- Format: `<scope>: <summary>` (<75 chars, imperative mood)
- Scope is the affected area (e.g., `eol`, `hil`, `docs`, `common`)
- No emojis in commit messages

**Branches:** `<user>/<PROJECT-###>/<topic-slug>` (with Jira integration)

- Example: `user/PROJ-123/add-feature`
- Fallback (no Jira): `<user>/<topic>`

**PRs:** Target main, squash merge, include description and test plan

- Include Jira link at bottom: `[PROJ-###](https://<site>.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-###)`

## Code Standards

- No spaces in filenames
- Unix LF line endings
- ASCII unless file already uses other characters
- Use existing toolchains over ad-hoc scripts
- Use `.git/info/exclude` for personal ignores
- Never create .md files unless explicitly instructed

## Python

- Use `uv` (not pip/poetry)
- Ruff for linting/formatting
- snake_case for files/directories

## Rust

- `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before commits
- snake_case for modules/files
