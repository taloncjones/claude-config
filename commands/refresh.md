The codebase structure may have changed since CLAUDE.md was last generated.

**Important**: Global instructions live in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Project CLAUDE.md should contain ONLY project-specific content.

**Step 1: Explore Current Structure**
- Use Glob to discover all major directories and file patterns
- Use Grep to find key architectural patterns, entry points, config files
- Identify technology stack and frameworks

**Step 2: Read Current CLAUDE.md**
- Compare documented structure with actual current structure
- Identify what's outdated, missing, or no longer relevant
- Note any custom notes that should be preserved

**Step 3: Update CLAUDE.md**
- Refresh directory structure with current state
- Update commands if build/test tooling changed
- Preserve custom notes and project-specific conventions
- Keep it concise - under 50 lines, no duplication of global instructions
- If the file has old verbose content (Contributing Guidelines, File Conventions, Security sections), remove them - those now live in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

**Step 4: Summary**
- Provide brief summary of what changed

Proceed with refresh now.
